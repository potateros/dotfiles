# dotfiles

My dotfiles for Unix-based systems.

All Ubuntu-only files are in the folder.

- [i3wm.md](i3wm.md) is specific to i3wm on Ubuntu. Last used on Ubuntu 17.04 with i3wm. Things have changed a lot since, so use only as reference.
- [ubuntu.md](ubuntu.md) is for a standard Ubuntu install. Last tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, things probably have changed.
- [macos.md](macos.md) is for a clean macOS machine. Last tested on macOS 10.15.5 Catalina.
- [wsl.md](wsl.md) will be updated with things for WSL2 on Windows in the future. Need to clean up my dotfiles-windows repo first.
