Configuration files for my i3wm install

Contains the config files for:

* i3wm `config` located in `~/.config/i3/`
* i3blocks `i3blocks.conf` located in `~/apps/i3blocks/`
* i3-volume `volume` located in `~/apps/i3-volume/`
* `.vimrc` located in `~/`
* `monokai.vim` located in `~/.vim/colors`

Scripts are in the `scripts` folder. I have added them to PATH, so if you want to use them directly in the terminal, be sure to do that.
