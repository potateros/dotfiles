# dotfiles

My dotfiles for my dev environments throughout the years.

All Ubuntu-only files are in the folder.

[guide-sh.md](guide-sh.md) are a bunch of stuff for the Unix shell (sh). I use ZSH, so it is used for ZSH. If you use other shells, proceed with caution.

The links below are setup steps that are specific to that particular environment.

- [guide-i3wm.md](guide-i3wm.md) is specific to i3wm on Ubuntu. Last used on Ubuntu 17.04 with i3wm. Things have changed a lot since, so use only as reference.
- [guide-ubuntu.md](guide-ubuntu.md) is for a standard Ubuntu install. Last tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, things probably have changed.
- [guide-macos.md](guide-macos.md) is for a clean macOS machine. Last tested on macOS 10.15.5 Catalina.
- [guide-windows.md](guide-windows.md) is for the Windows side of things, such as Windows Terminal, Powershell, and etc. These will be run under the Windows environment. Last tested on Windows 10 build 2004
- [guide-wsl.md](guide-wsl.md) is for WSL 2 on Windows. This assumes you already have some stuff set up in [guide-windows.md](guide-windows.md), as some things may be reliant on setting up Windows' environment.
