Configuration files for my Ubuntu install

(For step-by-step, I've added to [ubuntu.md](./ubuntu.md))

(I don't use i3wm currently, so check out my i3 steps [here](./i3wm.md)

(Tested on Xubuntu and Ubuntu, not sure about others)

- `.fonts/` are fonts that I use for both UI and editors

- `.vim/colors/monokai.vim` is my modified color scheme for vim

- `bin/` contains bash scripts that I make executable and added to PATH

- `scripts/` contain scripts to be placed in `~/apps/`

- `.gitignore` - default .gitignore for new projects

- `.vimrc` & `.zshrc` are to be placed in the home folder

- `apps.zip` to be extracted into `~/apps/`

- `config` is my i3 configuration file, to be placed in

- `redshift.conf` to be placed in `~/.config/`

- [Chromium](https://snapcraft.io/chromium)
- [Firefox](https://snapcraft.io/firefox)

- [Slack](https://snapcraft.io/slack)
- [Spotify](https://snapcraft.io/spotify)
- [VLC](https://snapcraft.io/vlc)

## To-Do

- Create a script that can automate most (if not all) of the processes above

- Test on other ubuntu-based distros

- Find a better screenshot tool
